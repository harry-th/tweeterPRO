 #tweeter pro
 Is an extension on the tweeter project focused mainly on teaching front end for the Ligthouse labs bootcamp. I wanted to make it a live app that people could send messages over. Took me about an extra day and a half, You can pick a profile picture, there's a little animation when you tweet and you can like other people posts. Taught good lessons on creating references to dynamic content.
